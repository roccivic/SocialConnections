<h1>Project Definition</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The project's name is College Social Connections. It will consist of a smart phone application and a PHP website.  The main goal of this project is to substitute the sheets of paper that lecturers use all the time for taking attendance, grading students, etc. Thus, making life easier for them by doing everyday, work related, tasks on their smart phones or the website instead. Students should also be able to view grades and their attendance on their smart phones or the website that will be provided.
</p>

<h2>The purpose of the project</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to make an easier way for lecturers to take attendance in all of their modules. In every college, attendance is very important to take note of.  Student grants can be affected by their attendance to lectures and marks can also be assigned based on attendance. The current method is very out-dated where a piece of paper is sent around the room and is signed by the students. This led to the idea of creating a quicker and modern way of taking attendance. The information that will be gathered will be easily gathered and aggregated.
It will also make it easier to access information regarding attendance and continual assessment results through an application on smartphones or through a web app. The current model of taking attendance is very slow and at times unreliable. It has to be considered that the application is not a necessity but the time it would save from each lecture makes it a productive application.
</p>

<h2>Our goals are:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make it easier and quicker for the lecturer to take attendance of a class group</li>
<li>Make it possible for lecturers to send results to individual students</li>
<li>Create a system that is easily translatable</li>
<li>Create an easily maintainable system</li>
<li>Make it easier and quicker for students to check their attendance and results</li>
</ul>


<h2>Client, Customer and other Stakeholders</h2>
<h3>Client</h3>
<p>
The client for this project is the Cork Institute of Technology. When the application is completed it will be possible to expand it to different mobile platforms, different languages and different colleges anywhere in the world.
</p>


<h3>The customer </h3>
<p>
There are four  types of customers that will use this application. Lecturers, students and head of departments that are part of Cork Institute of Technology. Also it is predicted that this application will be useful to the grant office as some grants are dependent on attendance of the student. For the application to be considered complete, all the customers should have a functional and useful application.
</p>

<h3>Other stakeholders</h3>
<p>
Lecturers of students - Other lecturers of students may want to see what a student of theirs attendance is like in other modules the student is enrolled in.</p>

	</p></dd>
	<dt>Subject Matter Experience</dt>
	<dd><p>
		Master. The lecturer will have knowledge of all the data as they will be contributing data to the system.
	</p></dd>
	<dt>Technological Experience</dt>
	<dd><p>
		Mid-range knowledge. The lecturer will not need to know how the system works but it is important for them to understand how to add, review, and modify data on the system to use the application fully.
	</p></dd>
	<dt>Other User Characteristics</dt>
	<dd><p>
		The lecturer will need to have the ability to either use a web browser or android application.<br />
		The application will be quite complex for the lecturer if they want to see information about students' attendance or results in other modules, so a good working knowledge of the application is crucial to gain full access to the system.<br />
		The lecturer will need to able to understand how to upload information through the application or web app for all other users to view.
	</p></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Head of department (Unimportant user)</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>User Role</dt>
	<dd><p>
		A head of department will be able to view data about any student on the system.
	</p></dd>
	<dt>Subject Matter Experience</dt>

	</p></dd>
	<dt>Other User Characteristics</dt>
	<dd><p>
		The head of a department will need to have the ability to either use a web browser or android application. <br />
		The application will be quite complex for the head of a department if they want to see information about students' attendance or results in certain modules, so a good working knowledge of the application is crucial to gain full access to the system.
	</p></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Administrator (Key user)</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>User Role</dt>
	<dd><p>
		An administrator will have the ability to manage the records of students, lecturers, and departments. Administrators could be a head of department, a lecturer, or staff from the administration office in CIT.
	</p></dd>
	<dt>Subject Matter Experience</dt>
	<dd><p>
		Master. An administrator will have access to all data and have the ability to modify and view any records.
	</p></dd>
	<dt>Technological Experience</dt>
	<dd><p>
		Master. An administrator will need to have full understanding of how all the data is stored so because they have access over all data stored so any error on their part may massive consequences on the whole system.
	</p></dd>
	<dt>Other User Characteristics</dt>
	<dd><p>
		An administrator will not need working knowledge of the android app, however they will need to know how to use the web app.
	</p></dd>
</dl>


<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p>
	All the data is stored in the cloud, therefore a persistent
	internet connection will be required to use the system.
</p>
<p>
	The Android smartphone/tablet must be equipped with a
	camera in order to be able to install the mobile app.
</p>
<p>
	JavaScript must be enabled in the user's browser if they
	are accessing the system using the Web App.
</p>
<p>
	The customer must have a registered Dropbox application.
</p>
<p>
	The customer must have a registered Twitter application.
</p>


<h2>Project Schedule</h2>
<p>
We are given 2 months to achieve that goal. The start date of the project is 28/01/13 and the deadline is the 29/03/13.
</p>
<p>
We are going to take up an agile approach. Our highest priority will be to satisfy the &quot;customer&quot; and meet the requirements. Our plan is to have regular team meetings and work closely with our supervisor.
</p>

<h3>Requirements specification phase</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 8 February 2013
</p>
<p>
We will find out who the stakeholders are, and their interactions with the system. Gathering requirements and documenting them is the next step. We will develop Use Case diagrams or different for better understanding of the problem. They will also be used as test cases when the system is developed.
</p>




<h3>Design phase</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 1 March 2013
</p>
<p>
Our objective is to make a simple, efficient, flexible, maintainable, secure, reliable and object-oriented design. We will use diagrams, such as UML, to illustrate the design and interactions between classes.
</p>

<h3>Implementation phase</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 22 March 2013
</p>
<p>
We are going to be using git as our source code management system. Our git repository is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/roccivic/SocialConnections/">https://github.com/roccivic/SocialConnections/</a>.
</p>

<h3>Testing and Further Developments</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 27 March 2013
</p>
<p>
We are going to take up a destructive approach, meaning that our goal, while testing, will be to prove that the system fails. After we have found the failings we will attempt to fix them.
</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 29 March 2013
</p>
<p>
The documentation of this project will be an ongoing process during all the phases.
