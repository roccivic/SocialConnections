<h1>Project Definition</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The project's name is College Social Connections. It will consist of a smart phone application and a PHP website with Joomla CMS.  The main goal of this project is to substitute the sheets of paper that lecturers use all the time for taking attendance, grading students, etc. Thus, making life easier for them by doing everyday, work related, tasks on their smart phones or the website instead. Students should also be able to view grades and their attendance on their smart phones or the website that will be provided.

1.5 Challanges:
We are expecting to meet some challanges which include:
Develop a working and user friendly system.
Deliver the working product on time.
Meet the requirements given.
Using new tools we have not used before.
Addressing the right problems for the right reasons.
Creating a good project control.
Developing a product that is flexible and maintenable.
Developing a product that people would want to use.
</p>
-->

<h2>Project Schedule</h2>
<p>
We are given 2 months to achieve that goal. The project's start date is 28/01/13 and the deadline is on the 29/03/13.
</p>
<p>
We are going to take up an agile approach. Our highest priority will be to satisfy the “customer” and meet the requirements. Our plan is to have regular team meetings and work closely with our supervisor.
</p>

<h3>Requirements specification phase</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 8 February 2013
</p>
<p>
We will find out who the stakeholders are, and their interactions with the system. Gathering requirements and documenting them is the next step. We will develop Use Case diagrams or different for better understanding of the problem. They will also be used as test cases when the system is developed.
</p>

<h3>Design phase</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 1 March 2013
</p>
<p>
Our objective is to make a simple, efficient, flexible, maintainable, secure, reliable and object-oriented design. We will used diagrams, such as UML, to illustrate the design and interactions between classes.
</p>

<h3>Implementation phase</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 22 March 2013
</p>
<p>
We are going to be using git as our source code management system. Our git repository is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/roccivic/SocialConnections/">https://github.com/roccivic/SocialConnections/</a>.
</p>

<h3>Testing and Further Developments</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 27 March 2013
</p>
<p>
We are going to take up a distructive approach, meaning that our goal, while testing, will be to prove that the system fails. After we have found the failings we will attempt to fix them.
</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 29 March 2013
</p>
<p>
The documentation of this project will be an ongoing process during all the phases.
