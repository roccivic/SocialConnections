<h1>Project Definition</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The project's name is College Social Connections. It will consist of a smart phone application and a PHP website.  The main goal of this project is to substitute the sheets of paper that lecturers use all the time for taking attendance, grading students, etc. Thus, making life easier for them by doing everyday, work related, tasks on their smart phones or the website instead. Students should also be able to view grades and their attendance on their smart phones or the website that will be provided.

<h2>The purpose of the project</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this project is to make an easier way for lecturers to take attendance in all of their modules. In every college, attendance is very important to take note of.  Student grants can be affected by their attendance to lectures and marks can also be assigned based on attendance. The current method is very out-dated where a piece of paper is sent around the room and is signed by the students. This led to the idea of creating a quicker and modern way of taking attendance. The information that will be gathered will be easily gathered and aggregated.
It will also make it easier to access information regarding attendance and continual assessment results through an application on smartphones or through a web app. The current model of taking attendance is very slow and at times unreliable. It has to be considered that the application is not a necessity but the time it would save from each lecture makes it a productive application.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Goals of the project</h3>
The primary goal for the development of this application is to make it easier and quicker to take attendance of a class group. It is important the main goal for this project, to develop an application for attendance, is fully accomplished.  We also want to make it possible for lecturers send results to individual students. To see if the application successfully meets the goal of the project we will test the application. A lecturer will attempt to take attendance through the face recognition option on a smartphone, any students not picked up by facial recognition, or that were absent, in the picture will have their names returned to the application. If there are any people that were not recognised, this can be remedied here. The lecturer, once logged in, can send results to the students. The lecturer can see the percentage of any students overall attendance of the module s/he teaches. The students can log in and will be alerted of new results available. Students can also see their previous results and their attendance percentage per module.
</p>


<h2>Client, Customer and other Stakeholders</h2>
<h3>Client</h3>
<p>
The client for this project, if it wwas to be used, would be Cork Institute of Technology. When the application is completed it will be possible to expand it to different mobile platforms, different languages and different colleges anywhere in the world.
</p>


<h3>The customer </h3>
<p>
There are four  types of customers that will use this application. Lecturers, students and head of departments that are part of Cork Institute of Technology. Also it is predicted that this application will be useful to the grant office as some grants are dependent on attendance of the student. For the application to be considered complete, all the customers should have a functional and useful application.
</p>

<h3>Other stakeholders</h3>
<p>
Lecturers of students - Other lecturers of students may want to see what a student of theirs attendance is like in other modules the student is enrolled in.</p>

<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p>
We have been given a very tight deadline. Because of this we have a schedule to make use of the limited time we have to have a functional demo by March 29th  
</p>
<p>
Project Deadline				Project Stage
1.	February 8th  			Project Definition and Requirements Specification.
2.	March 1st			Design					
3.	March 22th  			Implementation
4.	March 27th 			Testing and identification of failings, further developments
5.	March 29th			Documentation/Presentation/demo
</p>
<p>
We have also set a constraint on ourselves to make the application for the android mobile platform, due to the time restriction with option of expanding to the other mobile operating system. Also, since all the data is stored in the cloud, a persistent internet connection is need to use this application.
</p>


<h2>Project Schedule</h2>
<p>
We are given 2 months to achieve that goal. The project's start date is 28/01/13 and the deadline is on the 29/03/13.
</p>
<p>
We are going to take up an agile approach. Our highest priority will be to satisfy the &quot;customer&quot; and meet the requirements. Our plan is to have regular team meetings and work closely with our supervisor.
</p>

<h3>Requirements specification phase</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 8 February 2013
</p>
<p>
We will find out who the stakeholders are, and their interactions with the system. Gathering requirements and documenting them is the next step. We will develop Use Case diagrams or different for better understanding of the problem. They will also be used as test cases when the system is developed.
</p>

<h3>Design phase</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 1 March 2013
</p>
<p>
Our objective is to make a simple, efficient, flexible, maintainable, secure, reliable and object-oriented design. We will used diagrams, such as UML, to illustrate the design and interactions between classes.
</p>

<h3>Implementation phase</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 22 March 2013
</p>
<p>
We are going to be using git as our source code management system. Our git repository is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/roccivic/SocialConnections/">https://github.com/roccivic/SocialConnections/</a>.
</p>

<h3>Testing and Further Developments</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 27 March 2013
</p>
<p>
We are going to take up a distructive approach, meaning that our goal, while testing, will be to prove that the system fails. After we have found the failings we will attempt to fix them.
</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
Deadline: 29 March 2013
</p>
<p>
The documentation of this project will be an ongoing process during all the phases.
